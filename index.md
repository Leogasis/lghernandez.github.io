## About Me

I am an **Industrial Engineer** with a PhD in **Systems Engineering**, dedicated to solving complex industrial problems through quantitative methods. My work bridges the gap between theoretical models and real-world application, focusing on:

*   **Optimization & Operations Research:** Mathematical modeling for logistics, production, and supply chain efficiency.
*   **Artificial Intelligence applied to Industry:** Machine Learning and Deep Learning solutions for predictive maintenance, demand forecasting, and process control.
*   **Simulation & Stochastic Systems:**  Discrete-event and agent-based simulation for decision-making under uncertainty.

My goal is to design **robust, scalable, and data-driven solutions** that drive operational excellence.
