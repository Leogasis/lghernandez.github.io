title: "Artificial Intelligence for Industrial Decision-Making"
---

## Problem Context
Industrial organizations often face decision-making problems characterized by high uncertainty, large volumes of data, and complex interactions between variables. Traditional rule-based approaches are insufficient to capture these dynamics.

## Objective
To design and implement a data-driven decision support model using **machine learning techniques** to improve prediction accuracy and operational performance.

## Data Description
- Historical operational data
- Transactional and time-series records
- Categorical and numerical variables
- Medium-scale dataset (real industrial context)

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Supervised learning models (classification / regression)
- Model validation and performance comparison
- Integration into a decision-support workflow

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-learn / Pandas / NumPy
- Optimization and statistical analysis libraries

## Results
- Improved prediction accuracy compared to baseline methods
- Reduction in manual decision errors
- Actionable insights for operational planning

## Impact
The proposed approach enables **more robust, data-driven decisions**, directly supporting efficiency and performance improvements in industrial systems.
