## Project Context
**Client:** Automotive Parts Companies in Monterrey Metropolitan Area (2020–2021)

Several automotive suppliers in the region faced challenges with high transportation costs and inefficient routing for their local distribution methods.

## Objective
To optimize the logistics and distribution network to reduce mileage and improve delivery times.

## Solution
We developed an optimization model focusing on:
*   **Facility Location:** Determining optimal hubs for cross-docking.
*   **Vehicle Routing:** Implementing heuristic algorithms to solve the VRP (Vehicle Routing Problem) with time windows.

## Results
The project resulted in a consolidated distribution strategy that reduced transportation costs and improved service levels for the participating companies.
