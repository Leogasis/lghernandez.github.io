## Project Context
**Client:** Electoral Court of Nuevo León (2023–Present)

The Electoral Court required a modernization of their internal processes to improve efficiency and transparency. Manual handling of documentation and case files was leading to bottlenecks.

## Objective
To design and implement an AI-based system for the digitalization and automated classification of legal documents and court proceedings.

## Solution and Technologies
We implemented a solution leveraging:
*   **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):** To digitize physical archives.
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** To classify documents and extract key entities (dates, names, case types).
*   **Process Mining:** To identify inefficiencies in the current workflow.

## Impact
The system is currently being deployed, with expected improvements in document retrieval time and a significant reduction in administrative overhead.
