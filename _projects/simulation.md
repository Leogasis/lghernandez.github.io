## Problem Context
An urban hospital's Emergency Department (ED) was experiencing severe overcrowding and long patient wait times, negatively impacting patient safety and satisfaction.

## Objective
To identify bottlenecks in the patient flow and evaluate the impact of different staffing and layout configurations on throughput and wait times.

## Data Description
*   Patient arrival patterns (hourly, daily, seasonal).
*   Service time distributions for triage, consultation, and treatment.
*   Resource schedules (doctors, nurses, beds).

## Methodology
1.  **Process Mapping:** Mapped the detailed patient journey from arrival to discharge/admission.
2.  **Model Building:** Developed a verified Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model using AnyLogic.
3.  **Scenario Analysis:** Tested 10 different scenarios involving changes to triage logic, fast-track lanes, and staffing levels.

## Tools and Technologies
*   **Simulation Software:** AnyLogic
*   **Statistical Analysis:** R (for input modeling and output analysis)

## Results
*   **Wait Times:** Identified a configuration that reduced average Door-to-Doctor time by **30%**.
*   **Resource Utilization:** Balanced the workload among nursing staff, reducing burnout risk.
*   **Throughput:** Increased ED capacity by 15% without physical expansion.

## Impact
The hospital administration adopted the recommended "Fast-Track" layout and adjusted shift schedules based on the simulation results.
