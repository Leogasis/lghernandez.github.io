## Project Context
**Year:** 2019

Understanding user behavior in digital social and political contexts is crucial for analyzing trends and sentiment.

## Objective
To apply machine learning techniques to detect patterns and predict user behavior based on social media data.

## Methodology
*   **Data Collection:** Harvesting public social media data related to specific political events.
*   **Feature Engineering:** Extracting sentiment scores, interaction networks, and temporal features.
*   **Modeling:** Training classification models (Random Forest, SVM) to predict user engagement and stance.

## Outcome
The study provided quantitative insights into how social and political narratives spread and evolve online.
