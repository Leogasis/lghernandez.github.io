I am an Industrial Engineer with a strong background in Systems Engineering, focusing on the intersection of **optimization, advanced analytics, and artificial intelligence**. My research and professional practice are driven by the need to solve complex decision-making problems in industrial and service systems.

## Professional Background

I hold a PhD in Systems Engineering and have worked extensively in both academia and industry. My experience spans:

*   **Operations Research:** Design and implementation of optimization algorithms for logistics, supply chain management, and production scheduling.
*   **Data Science & AI:** Application of machine learning techniques for predictive modeling, anomaly detection, and process optimization.
*   **Simulation:** Development of discrete-event and agent-based simulation models to analyze system behavior under uncertainty.

## Philosophy

I believe in rigorously applying quantitative methods to real-world problems. My approach combines:
1.  **Deep Understanding:** Analyzing the underlying system dynamics.
2.  **Robust Modeling:** Creating mathematical models that accurately reflect reality.
3.  **Actionable Insights:** Delivering solutions that empower decision-makers.
